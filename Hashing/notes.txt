Some assumptions/things:
  We assumed that the keys go from 0-99 (or 0-199) rather than 1-100
  We assumed that each word should get written even if it is already there (ie we allowed duplicates)
    This is easy to change if you want no duplicates
  We allowed for extra characters in a word (ie , . [ ] " ")
    So "and" is different from "and,"

Some exceptions:
  We have thrown a FileNotFoundException.  This exception is thrown in each method in case the there is a problem with the input or output file.
